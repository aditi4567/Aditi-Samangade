A] SELinux :-
SELinux is an acronym for Security-enhanced Linux. It is a security feature of the Linux kernel. 
It is designed to protect the server against misconfigurations and/or compromised daemons. 
It put limits and instructs server daemons or programs what files they can access and what actions they can take by defining a security policy.

B] SELinux modes-
enforcing|permissive|disabled — Defines the top-level state of SELinux on a system.

1. enforcing — The SELinux security policy is enforced.

2. permissive — The SELinux system prints warnings but does not enforce policy.This is useful for debugging and troubleshooting purposes. 
In permissive mode, more denials are logged because subjects can continue with actions that would otherwise be denied in enforcing mode. 
For example, traversing a directory tree in permissive mode produces avc: denied messages for every directory level read. In enforcing mode, 
SELinux would have stopped the initial traversal and kept further denial messages from occurring.

3. disabled — SELinux is fully disabled. SELinux hooks are disengaged from the kernel and the pseudo-file system is unregistered.
